# Session 3
## Git Learning
- [ ] view commit history of a repo.  Note who is making changes, and when, and the messages

- [ ] open a file, edit it and commit it.  View the commit history again

- [ ] view the edited file (in GitHub or locally) and view the Git Blame

- [ ] create a branch, modify a file and commit it.  Do multiple minor commits.

- [ ] open a pull request from the branch into main.  Add comments.  Reject.  Add more commits.  Eventually approve and merge.

- [ ] have person one create a branch and modify a file.  have person two modify the same file and PR their change to main first.  Let person one experience and resolve the merge conflict.

- [ ] consider an intermediate exercise like cherry picking one commit to another branch, or another topic of choic
